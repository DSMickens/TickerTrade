The Following Projects are designed to aid in the success of stock trading on Nasdaq. They use YFinance and the Alpaca API for live data. 

# TickerBell
A CLI stock information and alert program designed to aid in the monitoring of stock prices. Allows the user to check stock information and create alerts for specific stocks at specific prices and be notified in various ways (terminal output, email, text message if allowed by cellular provider).

# TickerTrader
A CLI stock trading program designed to enable entering and exiting positions in a fraction of a second. Ideal for TA based scalping. TickerTrader is written entirely in Python and utilizes Alpaca API and YFinance for live data.

# TickerTracker - Private
A fully automated stock trading program that uses TA, linear regressions, and adaptive risk management strategies to enter and exit stock positions. It is written in Python and utilizes TickerTrader for opening and closing positions and YFinance for live data. The current version of TickerTracker will remain private for the time being.

# TickerTrackerPage
A locally hosted website that visualizes data captured during TickerTracker’s runtime. It is written from scratch using HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, and SQL to create a dynamic webpage. TickerTrackerPage uses the  Bootstrap 4 framework, the MYSQL DBMS, and runs on an Apache2 local server. Database entry is managed with Python, and Python’s matplotlib creates all graphs for the page. The page enables visual inspection into current TickerTracker practices and results and currently lays the groundwork for the ultimate goal of applying machine learning to optimize TickerTracker’s algorithm.
